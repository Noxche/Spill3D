## How to Work - Complete Beginner Guide

### Step 1: Open Your Project in Godot
1. Open Godot Engine
2. Click "Import" 
3. Navigate to this folder and select `project.godot`
4. Click "Open"

### Step 2: Set Up Visual Studio Code
1. In Godot, go to Editor â†’ Editor Settings
2. Find "Network â†’ Language Server"
3. Enable "Use Language Server"
4. In "External Editor", set path to VS Code

### Step 3: Your Daily Workflow

#### ðŸŽ® **In Godot** (Scene Building):
- Create new scenes (File â†’ New Scene)
- Add 3D objects and characters
- Import models and textures
- Set up physics and collisions
- Test your game (F5 or play button)

#### ðŸ’» **In VS Code** (Script Writing):
- Write GDScript code for game logic
- Edit configuration files
- Manage project structure
- Use Git for version control

### Step 4: Create Your First Scene

1. In Godot: File â†’ New Scene
2. Add a Node3D (right-click â†’ Add Node â†’ Node3D)
3. Save as `scenes/main/TrondheimWorld.tscn`
4. Add a script to the Node3D
5. This opens VS Code automatically!

## What Goes Where

### Godot Editor:
- **Scene creation** and layout
- **3D modeling** placement and positioning  
- **Material** assignment
- **Physics** setup
- **Testing** and debugging

### VS Code:
- **Writing scripts** (.gd files)
- **Editing project files**
- **Version control** (Git commits)
- **Documentation** writing

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Always save** your scenes before testing
2. **Name everything clearly** (no "Node3D", use "Player" instead)
3. **Test frequently** - run your game often
4. **Start small** - make a simple walking character first
5. **Use Godot's documentation** - it's excellent!

## Your First Goals

1. âœ… Create a simple 3D scene with a ground plane
2. âœ… Add a character that can move around
3. âœ… Add some basic Trondheim buildings
4. âœ… Implement camera follow
5. âœ… Add some Norwegian flavor (signs, colors, etc.)
