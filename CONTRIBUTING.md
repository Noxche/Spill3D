# Contributing to Trondheim 3D

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our open world game project!

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes following our coding standards
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Submit a pull request with clear description

## Coding Standards

### C# Scripts
- Use PascalCase for classes and methods
- Use camelCase for variables and fields
- Add XML documentation for public methods
- Keep methods focused and under 50 lines when possible

### Asset Organization
- Use descriptive names for all assets
- Follow the established folder structure
- Include LOD models for complex meshes
- Optimize textures for target platform

### Git Practices
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Use Git LFS for large binary files

## Asset Guidelines

### 3D Models
- Keep polycount reasonable for target performance
- Use proper UV mapping
- Include collision meshes where needed
- Name materials consistently

### Textures
- Use power-of-2 dimensions when possible
- Provide multiple resolutions for different platforms
- Use appropriate compression settings

## Testing

- Test on multiple platforms if possible
- Verify performance on target hardware
- Check for memory leaks in long play sessions

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue for discussion or clarification on any guidelines.
